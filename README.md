# AES Image Encryption and Decryption

Image encryption system that uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm to encrypt and decrypt images. Provide a secure way to transmit and store images by ensuring their confidentiality.

Python, PyCrypto are used to build an image encryption system. Python will be the primary language, PyCrypto will implement the AES algorithm.

The AES image encryption project will provide knowledge and skills in encryption techniques, AES algorithm implementation, image processing, GUI development, library integration, and project management.
